For example, a depositor who owns a single account is insured for up to a maximum of $250,000. If that depositor wishes to increase the amount of deposit insurance, they have several options, including opening accounts in different ownership categories which are available to them. For example, in addition to the single account which is insured for $250,000 per bank, the depositor could open a payable on death (POD) account and list his two children as beneficiaries. Assuming the depositor has met the requirements for opening a POD account, he would be insured for up to $500,000 because he has listed two beneficiaries and wishes to leave each beneficiary an equal share of the deposit when they die. Therefore the depositor would be able to increase his deposit insurance coverage by opening accounts under different ownership categories (Single and POD) at the same bank. Depositors should note that federal law expressly limits the amount of insurance the FDIC can pay to depositors when an insured bank fails, and no representation made by any person or organization can either increase or modify that amount.

      "answerHtml": "A: To achieve and maintain good credit scores, keep in mind the following:<br>•    Make sure you pay your bills and debts on time. You may want to consider automatic payments for your loans and credit cards using your bank’s bill pay service. This will help you pay on time, and on-time payments reflect well on your credit report.<br>•    Create a budget. Track when your payments are due, how much is due, and how much money is coming in each month to help you stay on track. For suggestions on how to create a budget, see the sample available in the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/february2019.html\" target=\"_blank\">FDIC Consumer News February 2019 issue</a>.<br>•    Pay down your debt. Having loan and credit card balances at their limits are expensive and can have a negative impact on your credit score. Use a strategy like paying the lowest balance debt off first, then pay the next lowest debt you owe so you can pay it off faster, and so on. Another common strategy is to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first so all of your hard earned money is paying down your debt, not just paying interest.<br>•    When you pay off your credit card or loan, you might think you should close them, which is fine if you have a lot of them. On the other hand, keeping a credit card that you have had for a long time will probably help your credit score.<br>•    If you cannot make your loan or credit card payments, call your banker or creditor right away. They may be able to help you with a solution before it becomes a problem that affects your credit score. Everyone has a financial hiccup once in a while. Don’t be afraid to reach out when it happens to you.

Make paying down or paying off your loans and credit cards a priority, before adding new debt, whenever possible.<br>•    Shop for credit only when you need it. Making numerous applications for loans is also reported to credit reporting agencies, and may lower your credit score.<br>•    Monitor your credit report.

      "answerHtml": "A: Unfortunately, banks sometimes fail, but bank failures occasionally occur in a functioning marketplace. When they do, the FDIC is working for you. Banks fail for a variety of reasons. When this happens, the bank’s chartering authority steps in to close the bank and bring in FDIC as the deposit insurer. FDIC staff is on location the day it fails, working to identify those who have insured money in the bank. If possible, another bank agrees to buy the failing bank and the transition is generally fairly smooth for depositors and borrowers. If there is no immediate buyer, the FDIC maintains access to depositors’ insured funds.

First, as the insurer of the bank's deposits, the FDIC pays insurance to depositors up to the insurance limit. Historically, the FDIC pays insurance within a few days after a bank closing, usually the next business day, by either (1) providing each depositor with a new account at another insured bank in an amount equal to the insured balance of their account at the failed bank, or (2) by issuing a check to each depositor for the insured balance of their account at the failed bank.\r\n \r\nSome deposits that exceed $250,000 and are linked to trust documents or deposits established by a third party broker may have a short wait so that their accounts can be reviewed to determine the amount of deposit insurance coverage available to them.

The FDIC insures trillions of dollars of deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts - deposits in virtually every bank and thrift in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/edie\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator</a> can help you determine if you have adequate deposit insurance for your accounts.</p>\n\n<p>The FDIC insures deposits only. It does not insure securities, mutual funds or similar types of investments that banks and thrift institutions may offer. (<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/deposit/covered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deposit Insurance: What&#39;s Covered</a> distinguishes between what is and is not protected by FDIC insurance.)</p>\n\n<p>The FDIC directly examines and supervises about 4,000 banks and savings banks for operational safety and soundness, more than half of the institutions in the banking system. Banks can be chartered by the states or by the federal government. Banks chartered by states also have the choice of whether to join the Federal Reserve System. The FDIC is the primary federal regulator of banks that are chartered by the states that do not join the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FDIC is the back-up supervisor for the remaining insured banks and thrift institutions.</p>\n\n<p>The FDIC also examines banks for compliance with consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth-In-Lending Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, to name a few. Finally, the FDIC examines banks for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they were chartered to serve.</p>\n\n<p>To protect insured depositors, the FDIC responds immediately when a bank or thrift institution fails. Institutions generally are closed by their chartering authority - the state regulator, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The FDIC has several options for resolving institution failures, but the one most used is to sell deposits and loans of the failed institution to another institution. Customers of the failed institution automatically become customers of the assuming institution. Most of the time, the transition is seamless from the customer&#39;s point of view.</p>\n\n<p>The FDIC is headquartered in Washington, D.C., but conducts much of its business in regional and field offices around the country.</p>\nThe FDIC is managed by a five-person <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/\" target=\"_blank\">Board of Directors</a>, all of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with no more than three being from the same political party.",

While federal law doesn’t protect business debit cards from liability for unauthorized transactions, your bank account agreement and state laws could limit your liability. If a credit card issuer provides 10 or more credit cards to a company for employee use, it may require the business to assume unlimited liability for unauthorized transactions. If fewer than 10 credit cards are issued to the company, the $50 limit will only apply to unauthorized use by someone other than an employee of the corporation.
