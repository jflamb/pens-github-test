      "summary": "FDIC insurance covers depositors' accounts at each insured bank, dollar-for-dollar, including principal and any accrued interest through the date of the insured bank's closing, up to the insurance limit. Depositors should note that federal law expressly limits the amount of insurance the FDIC can pay to depositors when an insured bank fails, and no representation made by any person or organization can either increase or modify that amount.\r\n\r\nYou can call the FDIC at 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342) and ask to speak to an FDIC deposit insurance specialist.

      "answerHtml": "<p>A depositor’s insurance amount depends on the ownership category in which the funds are held. For example, a depositor who owns a single account is insured for up to a maximum of $250,000. If that depositor wishes to increase the amount of deposit insurance, they have several options, including opening accounts in different ownership categories which are available to them. For example, in addition to the single account which is insured for $250,000 per bank, the depositor could open a payable on death (POD) account and list his two children as beneficiaries. Assuming the depositor has met the requirements for opening a POD account, he would be insured for up to $500,000 because he has listed two beneficiaries and wishes to leave each beneficiary an equal share of the deposit when they die. Therefore the depositor would be able to increase his deposit insurance coverage by opening accounts under different ownership categories (Single and POD) at the same bank. Depositors should note that federal law expressly limits the amount of insurance the FDIC can pay to depositors when an insured bank fails, and no representation made by any person or organization can either increase or modify that amount.

Understand that some people may take advantage of COVID-19 by using fraudulent websites, phone calls, emails, and text messages claiming to offer “help,” but may be trying to trick people into providing Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and other valuable details. Do not divulge your bank or credit card numbers or other personal information over the phone unless you initiated the conversation with the other party and you know that it is a reputable organization. In addition, you should be cautious about online solicitations. Be on guard against imposters who contact you claiming to be government employees or volunteers and who ask for personal financial information or money. Reject offers to cash a check for someone in exchange for a fee, even if the bank makes the funds available to you right away, as it may later turn out that the check was fraudulent.</p><p>Additional resources:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Bankers and Consumers</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnsum17/scams.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 Scams Targeting Bank Customers</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnsum18/problems.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weathering a Financial Storm</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnfall12/avoidfraud.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avoiding Fraud, Protecting Your Privacy: Best Practices for Young Adults</a>.</li></ul>",

The FDIC insures trillions of dollars of deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts - deposits in virtually every bank and thrift in the country.</p><p>The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC's <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/edie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator</a> can help you determine if you have adequate deposit insurance for your accounts.</p><p>The FDIC insures deposits only.

Banks can be chartered by the states or by the federal government. Banks chartered by states also have the choice of whether to join the Federal Reserve System. The FDIC is the primary federal regulator of banks that are chartered by the states that do not join the Federal Reserve System. In addition, the FDIC is the back-up supervisor for the remaining insured banks and thrift institutions.</p><p>The FDIC also examines banks for compliance with consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth-In-Lending Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, to name a few. Finally, the FDIC examines banks for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they were chartered to serve.</p><p>To protect insured depositors, the FDIC responds immediately when a bank or thrift institution fails. Institutions generally are closed by their chartering authority - the state regulator, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The FDIC has several options for resolving institution failures, but the one most used is to sell deposits and loans of the failed institution to another institution. Customers of the failed institution automatically become customers of the assuming institution. Most of the time, the transition is seamless from the customer's point of view.</p><p>The FDIC is headquartered in Washington, D.C., but conducts much of its business in regional and field offices around the country.</p><p>\nThe FDIC is managed by a five-person <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Board of Directors</a>, all of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with no more than three being from the same political party.</p>",

Since 1933, no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC insured funds.</p><p>Additional Resources:</p><ul><li>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information for Bankers and Consumers, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/coronavirus/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic | FDIC.gov</a>.</li><li>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/covid-19.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve System</a>.</li></ul>",
