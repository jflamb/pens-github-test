# Existing Experience Endpoint Field Matrix

Generated from authenticated endpoint snapshots on 2026-02-25.

Method: Navigate to each terminal form endpoint and parse interactive controls from accessibility snapshots (`textbox`, `combobox`, `radio`, `checkbox`).

Limitations:
- Conditional required fields that appear only after specific user selections may be undercounted.
- Required status is based on controls marked `required` in the snapshot at time of capture.
- Non-form external endpoints (FDIC.gov pages, catalog, FFIEC helpdesk, `factsemailsend`) are excluded.
