# Proposed Target IA Matrix

Drafted on **February 24, 2026** using the normalized production rule matrix as source data.

## Design Goals
- Remove duplicate intents and labels that route to the same backend destination.
- Use plain language for user-facing choices and preserve technical routing internally.
- Keep failed-bank tasks grouped by user goal (depositor, lien/collateral, records, assets).
- Route self-service content directly without forcing form intake where possible.

## Implementation Guidance
- Intake UI should expose only canonical intents/topics, then map to route codes internally.
- Preserve existing backend forms/endpoints during migration; reduce front-end duplication first.
- Maintain a separate self-service branch and a separate `View My Cases` branch outside intake.
