    uid=36_45 StaticText "A lender lien is typically a Deed of Trust or Mortgage document recorded in the public records by a lender so that the public is on notice that the lender has secured repayment of a loan by placing a lien against specific property. For example, when you borrow money from a lender to purchase a home, the lender will record a Deed of Trust or Mortgage document against your home with the appropriate agency in the county where the home is located. Once you repay your home loan, the lender should provide you a recordable lien release document stating that the lender releases its lien against your home. "
