- Trigger / correction: User flagged that endpoint forms had not been fully field-audited and suspected missing critical questions.
- Root cause: I completed routing/action-code normalization before finishing field-level parity validation across all terminal forms.
- Prevention rule: Do not claim pathway completeness until field-level inventories are captured for every form-bearing endpoint in scope.
- Actionable check for future tasks: For IA/form replacement work, produce a required-field matrix and gap report before finalizing intake schema decisions.
