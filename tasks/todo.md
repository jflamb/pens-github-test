# TODO

## Current Task
- [x] Audit vertical spacing and heading rhythm across support home, FAQ, intake, review, and confirmation pages.
- [x] Implement a consistent spacing pass in shared CSS (avoid page-specific one-off fixes).
- [x] Verify no JavaScript regressions after style changes.

## Review / Results
- Applied consistent vertical rhythm updates in `sites/fdic-public-information-faq/styles.css` for:
  - Above-content region spacing
  - Section spacing in support/form/review layouts
  - Heading and subcopy spacing
  - FAQ controls and content region spacing
- Primary issue addressed: tight space above “Review your submission” heading.
- Verification: JS syntax checks passed for all support/FAQ scripts.
